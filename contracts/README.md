Contracts Deployment Guide
==========================

This document explains how to deploy the LayerZero Hub, verifier, and `zERC20` token contracts that live in this directory. All deployment flows rely on Foundry scripts located under `script/`.

Prerequisites
-------------
- Foundry toolchain (`forge`, `cast`, `anvil`) installed via `foundryup`
- Soldeer-managed dependencies installed via `forge soldeer install`
- RPC endpoints for each network you intend to deploy to (for example Base Sepolia, Arbitrum Sepolia, Optimism Sepolia)
- A funded deployer key with permission to manage LayerZero configuration for the selected networks
- Endpoint IDs (EIDs) for every chain you plan to connect

Environment Variables
---------------------
The scripts consume environment variables through `vm.env*` helpers. Place the values in an `.env` file and load them with `source .env` before running any command.

### Shared
- `PRIVATE_KEY`: Hex-encoded private key for the broadcaster account (also used as the default delegate when overrides are omitted)
- `RPC_URL`: RPC endpoint that matches the target chain passed to `--rpc-url` (used for Hub deployment in the examples below)
- `VERIFIER_RPC`: RPC endpoint for the verifier/token chain (used only by the CLI flag in the example command)
- `DEPLOY_SALT` (string, optional): Overrides the base salt used for deterministic deployments

### Hub deployment (`DeployHub`)
- `HUB_EID` (uint32): LayerZero endpoint ID for the chain hosting the Hub (for reference/logging)
- `HUB_DELEGATE` (address, optional): Account that will own the Hub and manage LayerZero config; defaults to the broadcaster wallet if omitted
  - The LayerZero endpoint address is resolved automatically from `lz-address-book` using `block.chainid` (ensure the chain ID is supported there).

### Verifier and token deployment (`DeployVerifierAndToken`)
- `TOKEN_NAME` (string): ERC20 token name
- `TOKEN_SYMBOL` (string): ERC20 token symbol
- `HUB_EID` (uint32): Hub endpoint identifier the verifier should target
- `VERIFIER_DELEGATE` (address, optional): Account that can update verifier LayerZero config; defaults to the broadcaster wallet if omitted
- `TOKEN_OWNER` (address, optional): Account that will own the token; defaults to the broadcaster wallet if omitted
- `TOKEN_DECIMALS` (uint, optional): Token decimals; defaults to `18` and must be at least `6`
  - The LayerZero endpoint address is resolved automatically from `lz-address-book` using `block.chainid` (ensure the chain ID is supported there).

### Sample `.env`
```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=0xabc123...
RPC_URL=https://base-sepolia.example
VERIFIER_RPC=https://optimism-sepolia.example
DEPLOY_SALT=my-optional-salt

HUB_EID=40245
# HUB_DELEGATE=0xYourDelegate # optional; defaults to PRIVATE_KEY holder

TOKEN_NAME=zUSD
TOKEN_SYMBOL=zUSD
HUB_EID=40245
# VERIFIER_DELEGATE=0xYourVerifierDelegate # optional; defaults to PRIVATE_KEY holder
# LIQUIDITY_MANAGER=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# Peer configuration scripts
# HUB_ADDRESS=0xHubOnThisChain
# VERIFIER_ADDRESSES=0xVerifierA,0xVerifierB
# VERIFIER_EIDS=40246,40247
# TOKEN_ADDRESSES=0xTokenA,0xTokenB
# TOKEN_CHAIN_IDS=84532,421614
# VERIFIER_ADDRESS=0xVerifierOnThisChain
```

Pre-deploy Checks
-----------------
```bash
forge soldeer install
forge build
forge test
```
Run these commands inside `contracts/` to ensure the workspace compiles and tests pass before broadcasting transactions.

Coverage
--------
Generate an LCOV report for the Solidity tests:
```bash
forge coverage --report lcov --report-file lcov.info --ir-minimum --exclude-tests --no-match-coverage 'script/|src/verifiers/' && genhtml lcov.info --output-directory coverage
```
The LCOV report is written to `contracts/lcov.info` and the HTML output to `contracts/coverage/`.
Install `genhtml` via `lcov` if needed (e.g. `brew install lcov` on macOS, `sudo apt-get install -y lcov` on Debian/Ubuntu).
If you hit a "stack too deep" error during coverage, the `coverage` script uses `--ir-minimum` to enable `viaIR` with minimal optimization. The script also excludes `test/`, `script/`, and `src/verifiers/` from the coverage report.

Deploying the Hub
-----------------
```bash
forge script script/DeployHub.s.sol:DeployHub \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL \
  --broadcast \
  -vvvv
```
- Use the same `RPC_URL` chain that matches `HUB_EID`
- Add `--legacy` if the RPC only supports legacy gas pricing
- Pass `--etherscan-api-key <key>` to verify on the corresponding explorer, if supported

The script prints the deployed Hub address.

Deploying the Verifier and Token
--------------------------------
The `DeployVerifierAndToken` script now reads every parameter from environment variables. Ensure the required values listed above are exported (or loaded via `.env`) for the target chain, then run:
```bash
forge script script/DeployVerifierAndToken.s.sol:DeployVerifierAndToken \
  --rpc-url $VERIFIER_RPC \
  --broadcast \
  -vvvv
```
The script logs the addresses of the token, verifier, and each deployed Nova decider contract and wires the verifier into the token automatically.

Deploying Liquidity Manager and Adaptor
---------------------------------------
The `DeployLiquidity` script deploys an upgradeable `LiquidityManager` and, when provided a Stargate address, a stateless `Adaptor` wired to that manager.

Purpose notes:
- `LiquidityManager` is the liquidity policy boundary for the system. It exists to keep the zERC20 supply anchored to real underlying liquidity while encoding the incentive curve that governs when liquidity should be attracted or released.
- `Adaptor` is the cross-chain exit and recovery boundary. It exists to turn zERC20 inflows into a controlled release of underlying value via Stargate while preserving user intent through slippage limits and refund accounting when bridging conditions change.

Required env:
- `ZERC20` (address): zERC20 token the manager mints/burns.
- `LIQUIDITY_UNDERLYING_TOKEN` (address): Underlying ERC20 held by the manager.
- `PRIVATE_KEY` (uint256): Broadcaster key.

Optional env (defaults shown in `script/DeployLiquidity.s.sol`):
- `LIQUIDITY_TARGET` (uint256): Target liquidity level that drives rewards/fees (defaults to 1_000_000e6).
- `LIQUIDITY_K` (uint256): Incentive strength coefficient for wrap rewards/unwrap fees, expressed in basis points (1 = 0.01%; 10_000 = 1.0). Defaults to `0`, which disables curve-based incentives.
- `LIQUIDITY_OWNER` (address): Admin/fee manager for the LiquidityManager (defaults to broadcaster).
- `ADAPTOR_STARGATE` (address): When set, deploys the Adaptor wired to this Stargate instance.
- Defaults can also be sourced from `config/chain-config.json` (override with `CHAIN_CONFIG_PATH`), keyed by `block.chainid` with `underlyingToken` and `stargate` entries. Environment variables still take precedence for those values.
  - The LayerZero endpoint address is resolved automatically from `lz-address-book` using `block.chainid` (ensure the chain ID is supported there).

Example:
```bash
forge script script/DeployLiquidity.s.sol:DeployLiquidity \
  --rpc-url $VERIFIER_RPC \
  --broadcast \
  -vvvv
```

Registering the Token on the Hub
--------------------------------
After deploying the verifier and token, register the new token with the Hub owner account:
```bash
cast send $HUB_ADDRESS \
  "registerToken((uint64,uint32,address,address))" \
  "($REMOTE_CHAIN_ID,$REMOTE_EID,$VERIFIER_ADDRESS,$TOKEN_ADDRESS)" \
  --rpc-url $HUB_RPC \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```
- `$REMOTE_CHAIN_ID` is the EVM `chainid` of the verifier chain
- `$REMOTE_EID` must match the verifier`s `hubEid`
- Run `cast call $HUB_ADDRESS "eidToPosition(uint32)" $REMOTE_EID --rpc-url $HUB_RPC` to confirm the registration succeeded

Configuring LayerZero Peers After Deployment
-------------------------------------------
After every hub/verifier pair has been deployed and registered, wire the LayerZero peers using the dedicated Foundry scripts in `script/SetPeers.s.sol`. The order matters:

1. **Hub chain:** run `SetHubPeers` once to map every remote verifier EID to its address and register the associated token if it has not been registered yet.
2. **Each verifier chain:** run `SetVerifierPeers` separately so the verifier points back to the hub.

> Shortcut: the repo ships with `./run_set_peers.py` (with a `./run-set-peers.sh` wrapper), which reads `config/tokens.json` (per-entry `eid` required) and exports the required environment variables before running both scripts in order. Provide extra forge flags after `--` (for example `./run_set_peers.py -- --broadcast -vv`) and ensure `PRIVATE_KEY` is set in your shell.

```bash
# Step 1: run on the hub chain (all verifiers at once)
export HUB_ADDRESS=0xHubOnThisChain
export VERIFIER_ADDRESSES=0xVerifierA,0xVerifierB
export VERIFIER_EIDS=40246,40247
export TOKEN_ADDRESSES=0xTokenA,0xTokenB
export TOKEN_CHAIN_IDS=84532,421614
forge script script/SetPeers.s.sol:SetHubPeers \
  --rpc-url $HUB_RPC \
  --broadcast \
  -vvvv

# Step 2: run once per verifier chain
export HUB_ADDRESS=0xHubOnThisChain
export HUB_EID=40245
export VERIFIER_ADDRESS=0xVerifierOnThisChain
forge script script/SetPeers.s.sol:SetVerifierPeers \
  --rpc-url $VERIFIER_RPC \
  --broadcast \
  -vvvv
```

The helper contracts convert the hub address into the required 32-byte format automatically. Keep the environment variables scoped to the current chain before each run so that the correct RPC URL and addresses are used.

`SetHubPeers` registers new EIDs and calls `updateToken` for existing ones, so you can re-run the script safely as deployments change. Ensure each comma-separated list (`VERIFIER_ADDRESSES`, `VERIFIER_EIDS`, `TOKEN_ADDRESSES`, `TOKEN_CHAIN_IDS`) uses the same ordering so the data lines up per verifier.

Configuring LayerZero DVN / ULN Config
--------------------------------------
Use `script/SetDvnConfig.s.sol` to set ULN confirmations + DVN lists per OApp/remote EID. The helper `run_set_dvn_config.py` reads a per-chain JSON file plus `tokens.json` and derives all routes automatically (verifier<->hub + token<->token).

```bash
# Copy and edit the template
cp config/dvn-config.example.json config/dvn-config.json

# Run derived routes (defaults to --broadcast)
./run_set_dvn_config.py -- --broadcast -vv
```

The config file points at the `tokens.json` you already use (via `tokens_file`) and supplies two policies per token chain:
`verifier_hub` and `token`. The runner applies `verifier_hub` to both directions between hub and each verifier, and applies `token` to every outgoing token->token route from that chain.

DVN names must match the lz-address-book registry (see `getAvailableDVNs()` in `LZAddressContext` for discovery).

Troubleshooting Tips
--------------------
- Add `--resume` when rerunning a script that previously failed due to gas or fee settings
- Ensure the deployer wallet holds enough native gas token on every network involved
- If LayerZero fee quoting fails, double-check the endpoint address and confirm that the delegate has been granted the required permissions on the endpoint
